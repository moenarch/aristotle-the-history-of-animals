## Part 4

The last teeth to come in man are molars called 'wisdom-teeth', which come at the age of twenty years, in the case of both sexes.
Cases have been known in women upwards.
of eighty years old where at the very close of life the wisdom-teeth have come up, causing great pain in their coming; and cases have been known of the like phenomenon in men too.
This happens, when it does happen, in the case of people where the wisdom-teeth have not come up in early years.
