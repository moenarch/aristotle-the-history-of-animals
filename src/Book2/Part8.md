## Part 8

Some animals share the properties of man and the quadrupeds, as the ape, the monkey, and the baboon.
The monkey is a tailed ape.
The baboon resembles the ape in form, only that it is bigger and stronger, more like a dog in face, and is more savage in its habits, and its teeth are more dog-like and more powerful.

Apes are hairy on the back in keeping with their quadrupedal nature, and hairy on the belly in keeping with their human form-for, as was said above, this characteristic is reversed in man and the quadruped-only that the hair is coarse, so that the ape is thickly coated both on the belly and on the back.
Its face resembles that of man in many respects; in other words, it has similar nostrils and ears, and teeth like those of man, both front teeth and molars.
Further, whereas quadrupeds in general are not furnished with lashes on one of the two eyelids, this creature has them on both, only very thinly set, especially the under ones; in fact they are very insignificant indeed.
And we must bear in mind that all other quadrupeds have no under eyelash at all.

The ape has also in its chest two teats upon poorly developed breasts.
It has also arms like man, only covered with hair, and it bends these legs like man, with the convexities of both limbs facing one another.
In addition, it has hands and fingers and nails like man, only that all these parts are somewhat more beast-like in appearance.
Its feet are exceptional in kind.
That is, they are like large hands, and the toes are like fingers, with the middle one the longest of all, and the under part of the foot is like a hand except for its length, and stretches out towards the extremities like the palm of the hand; and this palm at the after end is unusually hard, and in a clumsy obscure kind of way resembles a heel.
The creature uses its feet either as hands or feet, and doubles them up as one doubles a fist.
Its upper-arm and thigh are short in proportion to the forearm and the shin.
It has no projecting navel, but only a hardness in the ordinary locality of the navel.
Its upper part is much larger than its lower part, as is the case with quadrupeds; in fact, the proportion of the former to the latter is about as five to three.
Owing to this circumstance and to the fact that its feet resemble hands and are composed in a manner of hand and of foot: of foot in the heel extremity, of the hand in all else-for even the toes have what is called a 'palm':-for these reasons the animal is oftener to be found on all fours than upright.
It has neither hips, inasmuch as it is a quadruped, nor yet a tail, inasmuch as it is a biped, except nor yet a tal by the way that it has a tail as small as small can be, just a sort of indication of a tail.
The genitals of the female resemble those of the female in the human species; those of the male are more like those of a dog than are those of a man.
