## Part 6

The ines (or fibrous connective tissue) are a something intermediate between sinew and vein.
Some of them are supplied with fluid, the lymph; and they pass from sinew to vein and from vein to sinew.
There is another kind of ines or fibre that is found in blood, but not in the blood of all animals alike.
If this fibre be left in the blood, the blood will coagulate; if it be removed or extracted, the blood is found to be incapable of coagulation.
While, however, this fibrous matter is found in the blood of the great majority of animals, it is not found in all.
For instance, we fail to find it in the blood of the deer, the roe, the antelope, and some other animals; and, owing to this deficiency of the fibrous tissue, the blood of these animals does not coagulate to the extent observed in the blood of other animals.
The blood of the deer coagulates to about the same extent as that of the hare: that is to the blood in either case coagulates, but not into a stiff or jelly-like substance, like the blood of ordinary animals, but only into a flaccid consistency like that of milk which is not subjected to the action of rennet.
The blood of the antelope admits of a firmer consistency in coagulation; for in this respect it resembles, or only comes a little short of, the blood of sheep.
Such are the properties of vein, sinew, and fibrous tissue.
