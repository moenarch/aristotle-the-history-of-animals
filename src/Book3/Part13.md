## Part 13

In all sanguineous animals membranes are found.
And membrane resembles a thin close-textured skin, but its qualities are different, as it admits neither of cleavage nor of extension.
Membrane envelops each one of the bones and each one of the viscera, both in the larger and the smaller animals; though in the smaller animals the membranes are indiscernible from their extreme tenuity and minuteness.
The largest of all the membranes are the two that surround the brain, and of these two the one that lines the bony skull is stronger and thicker than the one that envelops the brain; next in order of magnitude comes the membrane that encloses the heart.
If membrane be bared and cut asunder it will not grow together again, and the bone thus stripped of its membrane mortifies.
