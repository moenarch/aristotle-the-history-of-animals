## Part 14

The omentum or caul, by the way, is membrane.
All sanguineous animals are furnished with this organ; but in some animals the organ is supplied with fat, and in others it is devoid of it.
The omentum has both its starting-point and its attachment, with ambidental vivipara, in the centre of the stomach, where the stomach has a kind of suture; in non-ambidental vivipara it has its starting-point and attachment in the chief of the ruminating stomachs.
