## Part 22

All sanguineous animals eject sperm.
As to what, and how, it contributes to generation, these questions will be discussed in another treatise.
Taking the size of his body into account, man emits more sperm than any other animal.
In hairy-coated animals the sperm is sticky, but in other animals it is not so.
It is white in all cases, and Herodotus is under a misapprehension when he states that the Aethiopians eject black sperm.

Sperm issues from the body white and consistent, if it be healthy, and after quitting the body becomes thin and black.
In frosty weather it does not coagulate, but gets exceedingly thin and watery both in colour and consistency; but it coagulates and thickens under the influence of heat.
If it be long in the womb before issuing out, it comes more than usually thick; and sometimes it comes out dry and compact.
Sperm capable of impregnating or of fructification sinks in water; sperm incapable Of producing that result dissolves away.
But there is no truth in what Ctesias has written about the sperm of the elephant.
