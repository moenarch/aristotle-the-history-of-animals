## Part 26

Elephants suffer from flatulence, and when thus afflicted can void neither solid nor liquid residuum.
If the elephant swallow earth-mould it suffers from relaxation; but if it go on taking it steadily, it will experience no harm.
From time to time it takes to swallowing stones.
It suffers also from diarrhoea: in this case they administer draughts of lukewarm water or dip its fodder in honey, and either one or the other prescription will prove a costive.
When they suffer from insomnia, they will be restored to health if their shoulders be rubbed with salt, olive-oil, and warm water; when they have aches in their shoulders they will derive great benefit from the application of roast pork.
Some elephants like olive oil, and others do not.
If there is a bit of iron in the inside of an elephant it is said that it will pass out if the animal takes a drink of olive-oil; if the animal refuses olive-oil, they soak a root in the oil and give it the root to swallow.
So much, then, for quadrupeds.
