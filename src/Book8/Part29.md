## Part 29

Locality will differentiate habits also: for instance, rugged highlands will not produce the same results as the soft lowlands.
The animals of the highlands look fiercer and bolder, as is seen in the swine of Mount Athos; for a lowland boar is no match even for a mountain sow.

Again, locality is an important element in regard to the bite of an animal.
Thus, in Pharos and other places, the bite of the scorpion is not dangerous; elsewhere-in Caria, for instances-where scorpions are venomous as well as plentiful and of large size, the sting is fatal to man or beast, even to the pig, and especially to a black pig, though the pig, by the way, is in general most singularly indifferent to the bite of any other creature.
If a pig goes into water after being struck by the scorpion of Caria, it will surely die.

There is great variety in the effects produced by the bites of serpents.
The asp is found in Libya; the so-called 'septic' drug is made from the body of the animal, and is the only remedy known for the bite of the original.
Among the silphium, also, a snake is found, for the bite or which a certain stone is said to be a cure: a stone that is brought from the grave of an ancient king, which stone is put into water and drunk off.
In certain parts of Italy the bite of the gecko is fatal.
But the deadliest of all bites of venomous creatures is when one venomous animal has bitten another; as, for instance, a viper's after it has bitten a scorpion.
To the great majority of such creatures man's is fatal.
There is a very little snake, by some entitled the 'holy-snake', which is dreaded by even the largest serpents.
It is about an ell long, and hairy-looking; whenever it bites an animal, the flesh all round the wound will at once mortify.
There is in India a small snake which is exceptional in this respect, that for its bite no specific whatever is known.
