## Part 8

Horses, mules, and asses feed on corn and grass, but are fattened chiefly by drink.
Just in proportion as beasts of burden drink water, so will they more or less enjoy their food, and a place will give good or bad feeding according as the water is good or bad.
Green corn, while ripening, will give a smooth coat; but such corn is injurious if the spikes are too stiff and sharp.
The first crop of clover is unwholesome, and so is clover over which ill-scented water runs; for the clover is sure to get the taint of the water.
Cattle like clear water for drinking; but the horse in this respect resembles the camel, for the camel likes turbid and thick water, and will never drink from a stream until he has trampled it into a turbid condition.
And, by the way, the camel can go without water for as much as four days, but after that when he drinks, he drinks in immense quantities.
