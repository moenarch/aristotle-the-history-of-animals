## Part 22

Dogs suffer from three diseases; rabies, quinsy, and sore feet.
Rabies drives the animal mad, and ary animal whatever, excepting man, will take the disease if bitten by a dog so afflicted; the disease is fatal to the dog itself, and to any animal it may bite, man excepted.
Quinsy also is fatal to dogs; and only a few recover from disease of the feet.
The camel, like the dog, is subject to rabies.
The elephant, which is reputed to enjoy immunity from all other illnesses, is occasionally subject to flatulency.
