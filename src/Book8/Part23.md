## Part 23

Cattle in herds are liable to two diseases, foot, sickness and craurus.
In the former their feet suffer from eruptions, but the animal recovers from the disease without even the loss of the hoof.
It is found of service to smear the horny parts with warm pitch.
In craurus, the breath comes warm at short intervals; in fact, craurus in cattle answers to fever in man.
The symptoms of the disease are drooping of the ears and disinclination for food.
The animal soon succumbs, and when the carcase is opened the lungs are found to be rotten.
