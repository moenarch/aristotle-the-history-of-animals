## Part 20

River-fish and lake-fish also are exempt from diseases of a pestilential character, but certain species are subject to special and peculiar maladies.
For instance, the sheat-fish just before the rising of the Dog-star, owing to its swimming near the surface of the water, is liable to sunstroke, and is paralysed by a loud peal of thunder.
The carp is subject to the same eventualities but in a lesser degree.
The sheatfish is destroyed in great quantities in shallow waters by the serpent called the dragon.
In the balerus and tilon a worm is engendered about the rising of the Dog-star, that sickens these fish and causes them to rise towards the surface, where they are killed by the excessive heat.
The chalcis is subject to a very violent malady; lice are engendered underneath their gills in great numbers, and cause destruction among them; but no other species of fish is subject to any such malady.

If mullein be introduced into water it will kill fish in its vicinity.
It is used extensively for catching fish in rivers and ponds; by the Phoenicians it is made use of also in the sea.

There are two other methods employed for catch-fish.
It is a known fact that in winter fishes emerge from the deep parts of rivers and, by the way, at all seasons fresh water is tolerably cold.
A trench accordingly is dug leading into a river, and wattled at the river end with reeds and stones, an aperture being left in the wattling through which the river water flows into the trench; when the frost comes on the fish can be taken out of the trench in weels.
Another method is adopted in summer and winter alike.
They run across a stream a dam composed of brushwood and stones leaving a small open space, and in this space they insert a weel; they then coop the fish in towards this place, and draw them up in the weel as they swim through the open space.

Shell-fish, as a rule, are benefited by rainy weather.
The purple murex is an exception; if it be placed on a shore near to where a river discharges, it will die within a day after tasting the fresh water.
The murex lives for about fifty days after capture; during this period they feed off one another, as there grows on the shell a kind of sea-weed or sea-moss; if any food is thrown to them during this period, it is said to be done not to keep them alive, but to make them weigh more.

To shell-fish in general drought is unwholesome.
During dry weather they decrease in size and degenerate in quality; and it is during such weather that the red scallop is found in more than usual abundance.
In the Pyrrhaean Strait the clam was exterminated, partly by the dredging-machine used in their capture, and partly by long-continued droughts.
Rainy weather is wholesome to the generality of shellfish owing to the fact that the sea-water then becomes exceptionally sweet.
In the Euxine, owing to the coldness of the climate, shellfish are not found: nor yet in rivers, excepting a few bivalves here and there.
Univalves, by the way, are very apt to freeze to death in extremely cold weather.
So much for animals that live in water.
