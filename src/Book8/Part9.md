## Part 9

The elephant at the most can eat nine Macedonian medimni of fodder at one meal; but so large an amount is unwholesome.
As a general rule it can take six or seven medimni of fodder, five medimni of wheat, and five mareis of wine-six cotylae going to the maris.
An elephant has been known to drink right off fourteen Macedonian metretae of water, and another metretae later in the day.

Camels live for about thirty years; in some exceptional cases they live much longer, and instances have been known of their living to the age of a hundred.
The elephant is said by some to live for about two hundred years; by others, for three hundred.
