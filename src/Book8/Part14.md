## Part 14

Insects almost all go into hiding, with the exception of such of them as live in human habitations or perish before the completion of the year.
They hide in the winter; some of them for several days, others for only the coldest days, as the bee.
For the bee also goes into hiding: and the proof that it does so is that during a certain period bees never touch the food set before them, and if a bee creeps out of the hive, it is quite transparent, with nothing whatsoever in its stomach; and the period of its rest and hiding lasts from the setting of the Pleiads until springtime.

Animals take their winter-sleep or summer-sleep by concealing themselves in warm places, or in places where they have been used to lie concealed.
