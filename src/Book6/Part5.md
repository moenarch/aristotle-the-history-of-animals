## Part 5

The vulture builds its nest on inaccessible cliffs; for which reason its nest and young are rarely seen.
And therefore Herodorus, father of Bryson the Sophist, declares that vultures belong to some foreign country unknown to us, stating as a proof of the assertion that no one has ever seen a vulture's nest, and also that vultures in great numbers make a sudden appearance in the rear of armies.
However, difficult as it is to get a sight of it, a vulture's nest has been seen.
The vulture lays two eggs.

(Carnivorous birds in general are observed to lay but once a year.
The swallow is the only carnivorous bird that builds a nest twice.
If you prick out the eyes of swallow chicks while they are yet young, the birds will get well again and will see by and by.)
