## Part 6

The eagle lays three eggs and hatches two of them, as it is said in the verses ascribed to Musaeus:

That lays three, hatches two, and cares for one.

This is the case in most instances, though occasionally a brood of three has been observed.
As the young ones grow, the mother becomes wearied with feeding them and extrudes one of the pair from the nest.
At the same time the bird is said to abstain from food, to avoid harrying the young of wild animals.
That is to say, its wings blanch, and for some days its talons get turned awry.
It is in consequence about this time cross-tempered to its own young.
The phene is said to rear the young one that has been expelled the nest.
The eagle broods for about thirty days.

The hatching period is about the same for the larger birds, such as the goose and the great bustard; for the middle-sized birds it extends over about twenty days, as in the case of the kite and the hawk.
The kite in general lays two eggs, but occasionally rears three young ones.
The so-called aegolius at times rears four.
It is not true that, as some aver, the raven lays only two eggs; it lays a larger number.
It broods for about twenty days and then extrudes its young.
Other birds perform the same operation; at all events mother birds that lay several eggs often extrude one of their young.

Birds of the eagle species are not alike in the treatment of their young.
The white-tailed eagle is cross, the black eagle is affectionate in the feeding of the young; though, by the way, all birds of prey, when their brood is rather forward in being able to fly, beat and extrude them from the nest.
The majority of birds other than birds of prey, as has been said, also act in this manner, and after feeding their young take no further care of them; but the crow is an exception.
This bird for a considerable time takes charge of her young; for, even when her young can fly, she flies alongside of them and supplies them with food.
