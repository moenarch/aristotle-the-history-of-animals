## Part 34

The fox mounts the vixen in copulation, and the vixen bears young like the she-bear; in fact, her young ones are even more inarticulately formed.
Before parturition she retires to sequestered places, so that it is a great rarity for a vixen to be caught while pregnant.
After parturition she warms her young and gets them into shape by licking them.
She bears four at most at a birth.
