## Part 12

The dolphin, the whale, and all the rest of the Cetacea, all, that is to say, that are provided with a blow-hole instead of gills, are viviparous.
That is to say, no one of all these fishes is ever seen to be supplied with eggs, but directly with an embryo from whose differentiation comes the fish, just as in the case of mankind and the viviparous quadrupeds.

The dolphin bears one at a time generally, but occasionally two.
The whale bears one or at the most two, generally two.
The porpoise in this respect resembles the dolphin, and, by the way, it is in form like a little dolphin, and is found in the Euxine; it differs, however, from the dolphin as being less in size and broader in the back; its colour is leaden-black.
Many people are of opinion that the porpoise is a variety of the dolphin.

All creatures that have a blow-hole respire and inspire, for they are provided with lungs.
The dolphin has been seen asleep with his nose above water, and when asleep he snores.

The dolphin and the porpoise are provided with milk, and suckle their young.
They also take their young, when small, inside them.
The young of the dolphin grow rapidly, being full grown at ten years of age.
Its period of gestation is ten months.
It brings forth its young summer, and never at any other season; (and, singularly enough, under the Dogstar it disappears for about thirty days).
Its young accompany it for a considerable period; and, in fact, the creature is remarkable for the strength of its parental affection.
It lives for many years; some are known to have lived for more than twenty-five, and some for thirty years; the fact is fishermen nick their tails sometimes and set them adrift again, and by this expedient their ages are ascertained.

The seal is an amphibious animal: that is to say, it cannot take in water, but breathes and sleeps and brings forth on dry land-only close to the shore-as being an animal furnished with feet; it spends, however, the greater part of its time in the sea and derives its food from it, so that it must be classed in the category of marine animals.
It is viviparous by immediate conception and brings forth its young alive, and exhibits an after-birth and all else just like a ewe.
It bears one or two at a time, and three at the most.
It has two teats, and suckles its young like a quadruped.
Like the human species it brings forth at all seasons of the year, but especially at the time when the earliest kids are forthcoming.
It conducts its young ones, when they are about twelve days old, over and over again during the day down to the sea, accustoming them by slow degrees to the water.
It slips down steep places instead of walking, from the fact that it cannot steady itself by its feet.
It can contract and draw itself in, for it is fleshy and soft and its bones are gristly.
Owing to the flabbiness of its body it is difficult to kill a seal by a blow, unless you strike it on the temple.
It looks like a cow.
The female in regard to its genital organs resembles the female of the ray; in all other respects it resembles the female of the human species.

So much for the phenomena of generation and of parturition in animals that live in water and are viviparous either internally or externally.
