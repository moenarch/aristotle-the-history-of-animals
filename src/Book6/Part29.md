## Part 29

The hind, as has been stated, submits to the stag as a rule only under compulsion, as she is unable to endure the male often owing to the rigidity of the penis.
However, they do occasionally submit to the stag as the ewe submits ram; and when they are in heat the hinds avoid one another.
The stag is not constant to one particular hind, but after a while quits one and mates with others.
The breeding time is after the rising of Arcturus, during the months of Boedromion and Maimacterion.
The period of gestation lasts for eight months.
Conception comes on a few days after intercourse; and a number of hinds can be impregnated by a single male.
The hind, as a rule, bears but one fawn, although instances have been known of her casting two.
Out of dread of wild beasts she casts her young by the side of the high-road.
The young fawn grows with rapidity.
Menstruation occurs at no other time with the hind; it takes place only after parturition, and the substance is phlegm-like.

The hind leads the fawn to her lair; this is her place of refuge, a cave with a single inlet, inside which she shelters herself against attack.

Fabulous stories are told concerning the longevity of the animal, but the stories have never been verified, and the brevity of the period of gestation and the rapidity of growth in the fawn would not lead one to attribute extreme longevity to this creature.

In the mountain called Elaphoeis or Deer Mountain, which is in Arginussa in Asia Minor-the place, by the way, where Alcibiades was assassinated-all the hinds have the ear split, so that, if they stray to a distance, they can be recognized by this mark; and the embryo actually has the mark while yet in the womb of the mother.

The hind has four teats like the cow.
After the hinds have become pregnant, the males all segregate one by one, and in consequence of the violence of their sexual passions they keep each one to himself, dig a hole in the ground, and bellow from time to time; in all these particulars they resemble the goat, and their foreheads from getting wetted become black, as is also the case with the goat.
In this way they pass the time until the rain falls, after which time they turn to pasture.
The animal acts in this way owing to its sexual wantonness and also to its obesity; for in summer-time it becomes so exceptionally fat as to be unable to run: in fact at this period they can be overtaken by the hunters that pursue them on foot in the second or third run; and, by the way, in consequence of the heat of the weather and their getting out of breath they always make for water in their runs.
In the rutting season, the flesh of the deer is unsavoury and rank, like the flesh of the he-goat.
In winter-time the deer becomes thin and weak, but towards the approach of the spring he is at his best for running.
When on the run the deer keeps pausing from time to time, and waits until his pursuer draws upon him, whereupon he starts off again.
This habit appears due to some internal pain: at all events, the gut is so slender and weak that, if you strike the animal ever so softly, it is apt to break asunder, though the hide of the animal remains sound and uninjured.
