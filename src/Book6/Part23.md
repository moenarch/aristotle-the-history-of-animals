## Part 23

The ass of both sexes is capable of breeding, and sheds its first teeth at the age of two and a half years; it sheds its second teeth within six months, its third within another six months, and the fourth after the like interval.
These fourth teeth are termed the gnomons or age-indicators.

A she-ass has been known to conceive when a year old, and the foal to be reared.
After intercourse with the male it will discharge the genital sperm unless it be hindered, and for this reason it is usually beaten after such intercourse and chased about.
It casts its young in the twelfth month.
It usually bears but one foal, and that is its natural number, occasionally however it bears twins.
The ass if it cover a mare destroys, as has been said, the embryo previously begotten by the horse; but, after the mare has been covered by the ass, the horse supervening will not spoil the embryo.
The she-ass has milk in the tenth month of pregnancy.
Seven days after casting a foal the she-ass submits to the male, and is almost sure to conceive if put to the male on this particular day; the same result, however, is quite possible later on.
The she-ass will refuse to cast her foal with any one looking on or in the daylight and just before foaling she has to be led away into a dark place.
If the she-ass has had young before the shedding of the index-teeth, she will bear all her life through; but if not, then she will neither conceive nor bear for the rest of her days.
The ass lives for more than thirty years, and the she-ass lives longer than the male.

When there is a cross between a horse and a she-ass or a jackass and a mare, there is much greater chance of a miscarriage than where the commerce is normal.
The period for gestation in the case of a cross depends on the male, and is just what it would have been if the male had had commerce with a female of his own kind.
In regard to size, looks, and vigour, the foal is more apt to resemble the mother than the sire.
If such hybrid connexions be continued without intermittence, the female will soon go sterile; and for this reason trainers always allow of intervals between breeding times.
A mare will not take the ass, nor a she ass the horse, unless the ass or she-ass shall have been suckled by a mare; and for this reason trainers put foals of the she-ass under mares, which foals are technically spoken of as 'mare-suckled'.
These asses, thus reared, mount the mares in the open pastures, mastering them by force as the stallions do.
