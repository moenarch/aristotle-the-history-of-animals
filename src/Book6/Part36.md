## Part 36

There is found in Syria a so-called mule.
It is not the same as the cross between the horse and ass, but resembles it just as a wild ass resembles the domesticated congener, and derives its name from the resemblance.
Like the wild ass, this wild mule is remarkable for its speed.
The animals of this species interbreed with one another; and a proof of this statement may be gathered from the fact that a certain number of them were brought into Phrygia in the time of Pharnaces, the father of Pharnabazus, and the animal is there still.
The number originally introduced was nine, and there are three there at the present day.
