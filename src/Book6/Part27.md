## Part 27

The elephant of either sex is fitted for breeding before reaching the age of twenty.
The female carries her young, according to some accounts, for two and a half years; according to others, for three years; and the discrepancy in the assigned periods is due to the fact that there are never human eyewitnesses to the commerce between the sexes.
The female settles down on its rear to cast its young, and obviously suffers greatly during the process.
The young one, immediately after birth, sucks the mother, not with its trunk but with the mouth; and can walk about and see distinctly the moment it is born.
