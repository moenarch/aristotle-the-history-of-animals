## Part 20

Of dogs there are several breeds.
Of these the Laconian hound of either sex is fit for breeding purposes when eight months old: at about the same age some dogs lift the leg when voiding urine.
The bitch conceives with one lining; this is clearly seen in the case where a dog contrives to line a bitch by stealth, as they impregnate after mounting only once.
The Laconian bitch carries her young the sixth part of a year or sixty days: or more by one, two, or three, or less by one; the pups are blind for twelve days after birth.
After pupping, the bitch gets in heat again in six months, but not before.
Some bitches carry their young for the fifth part of the year or for seventy-two days; and their pups are blind for fourteen days.
Other bitches carry their young for a quarter of a year or for three whole months; and the whelps of these are blind for seventeen days.
The bitch appears go in heat for the same length of time.
Menstruation continues for seven days, and a swelling of the genital organ occurs simultaneously; it is not during this period that the bitch is disposed to submit to the dog, but in the seven days that follow.
The bitch as a rule goes in heat for fourteen days, but occasionally for sixteen.
The birth-discharge occurs simultaneously with the delivery of the whelps, and the substance of it is thick and mucous.
(The falling-off in bulk on the part of the mother is not so great as might have been inferred from the size of her frame.)
The bitch is usually supplied with milk five days before parturition; some seven days previously, some four; and the milk is serviceable immediately after birth.
The Laconian bitch is supplied with milk thirty days after lining.
The milk at first is thickish, but gets thinner by degrees; with the bitch the milk is thicker than with the female of any other animal excepting the sow and the hare.
When the bitch arrives at full growth an indication is given of her capacity for the male; that is to say, just as occurs in the female of the human species, a swelling takes place in the teats of the breasts, and the breasts take on gristle.
This incident, however, it is difficult for any but an expert to detect, as the part that gives the indication is inconsiderable.
The preceding statements relate to the female, and not one of them to the male.
The male as a rule lifts his leg to void urine when six months old; some at a later period, when eight months old, some before they reach six months.
In a general way one may put it that they do so when they are out of puppyhood.
The bitch squats down when she voids urine; it is a rare exception that she lifts the leg to do so.
The bitch bears twelve pups at the most, but usually five or six; occasionally a bitch will bear one only.
The bitch of the Laconian breed generally bears eight.
The two sexes have intercourse with each other at all periods of life.
A very remarkable phenomenon is observed in the case of the Laconian hound: in other words, he is found to be more vigorous in commerce with the female after being hard-worked than when allowed to live idle.

The dog of the Laconian breed lives ten years, and the bitch twelve.
The bitch of other breeds usually lives for fourteen or fifteen years, but some live to twenty; and for this reason certain critics consider that Homer did well in representing the dog of Ulysses as having died in his twentieth year.
With the Laconian hound, owing to the hardships to which the male is put, he is less long-lived than the female; with other breeds the distinction as to longevity is not very apparent, though as a general rule the male is the longer-lived.

The dog sheds no teeth except the so-called 'canines'; these a dog of either sex sheds when four months old.
As they shed these only, many people are in doubt as to the fact, and some people, owing to their shedding but two and its being hard to hit upon the time when they do so, fancy that the animal sheds no teeth at all; others, after observing the shedding of two, come to the conclusion that the creature sheds the rest in due turn.
Men discern the age of a dog by inspection of its teeth; with young dogs the teeth are white and sharp pointed, with old dogs black and blunted.
