## Part 30

Bears, as has been previously stated, do not copulate with the male mounting the back of the female, but with the female lying down under the male.
The she-bear goes with young for thirty days.
She brings forth sometimes one cub, sometimes two cubs, and at most five.
Of all animals the newly born cub of the she bear is the smallest in proportion to the size of the mother; that is to say, it is larger than a mouse but smaller than a weasel.
It is also smooth and blind, and its legs and most of its organs are as yet inarticulate.
Pairing takes Place in the month of Elaphebolion, and parturition about the time for retiring into winter quarters; about this time the bear and the she-bear are at the fattest.
After the she-bear has reared her young, she comes out of her winter lair in the third month, when it is already spring.
The female porcupine, by the way, hibernates and goes with young the same number of days as the she-bear, and in all respects as to parturition resembles this animal.
When a she-bear is with young, it is a very hard task to catch her.
