## Part 33

Hares copulate in a rearward posture, as has been stated, for the animal is opisthuretic.
They breed and bear at all seasons, superfoetate during pregnancy, and bear young every month.
They do not give birth to their young ones all together at one time, but bring them forth at intervals over as many days as the circumstances of each case may require.
The female is supplied with milk before parturition; and after bearing submits immediately to the male, and is capable of conception while suckling her young.
The milk in consistency resembles sow's milk.
The young are born blind, as is the case with the greater part Of the fissipeds or toed animals.
