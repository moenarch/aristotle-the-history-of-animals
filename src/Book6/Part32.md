## Part 32

The hyena in colour resembles the wolf, but is more shaggy, and is furnished with a mane running all along the spine.
What is recounted concerning its genital organs, to the effect that every hyena is furnished with the organ both of the male and the female, is untrue.
The fact is that the sexual organ of the male hyena resembles the same organ in the wolf and in the dog; the part resembling the female genital organ lies underneath the tail, and does to some extent resemble the female organ, but it is unprovided with duct or passage, and the passage for the residuum comes underneath it.
The female hyena has the part that resembles the organ of the male, and, as in the case of the male, has it underneath her tail, unprovided with duct or passage; and after it the passage for the residuum, and underneath this the true female genital organ.
The female hyena has a womb, like all other female animals of the same kind.
It is an exceedingly rare circumstance to meet with a female hyena.
At least a hunter said that out of eleven hyenas he had caught, only one was a female.
