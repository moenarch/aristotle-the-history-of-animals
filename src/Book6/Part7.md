## Part 7

The cuckoo is said by some to be a hawk transformed, because at the time of the cuckoo's coming, the hawk, which it resembles, is never seen; and indeed it is only for a few days that you will see hawks about when the cuckoo's note sounds early in the season.
The cuckoo appears only for a short time in summer, and in winter disappears.
The hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo has not; neither with regard to the head does the cuckoo resemble the hawk.
In point of fact, both as regards the head and the claws it more resembles the pigeon.
However, in colour and in colour alone it does resemble the hawk, only that the markings of the hawk are striped, and of the cuckoo mottled.
And, by the way, in size and flight it resembles the smallest of the hawk tribe, which bird disappears as a rule about the time of the appearance of the cuckoo, though the two have been seen simultaneously.
The cuckoo has been seen to be preyed on by the hawk; and this never happens between birds of the same species.
They say no one has ever seen the young of the cuckoo.
The bird eggs, but does not build a nest.
Sometimes it lays its eggs in the nest of a smaller bird after first devouring the eggs of this bird; it lays by preference in the nest of the ringdove, after first devouring the eggs of the pigeon.
(It occasionally lays two, but usually one.)
It lays also in the nest of the hypolais, and the hypolais hatches and rears the brood.
It is about this time that the bird becomes fat and palatable.
(The young of hawks also get palatable and fat.
One species builds a nest in the wilderness and on sheer and inaccessible cliffs.)
