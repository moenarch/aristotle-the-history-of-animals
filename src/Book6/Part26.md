## Part 26

The camel carries its young for ten months, and bears but one at a time and never more; the young camel is removed from the mother when a year old.
The animal lives for a long period, more than fifty years.
It bears in spring-time, and gives milk until the time of the next conception.
Its flesh and milk are exceptionally palatable.
The milk is drunk mixed with water in the proportion of either two to one or three to one.
