## Part 31

It has already been stated that the lion and lioness copulate rearwards, and that these animals are opisthuretic.
They do not copulate nor bring forth at all seasons indiscriminately, but once in the year only.
The lioness brings forth in the spring, generally two cubs at a time, and six at the very most; but sometimes only one.
The story about the lioness discharging her womb in the act of parturition is a pure fable, and was merely invented to account for the scarcity of the animal; for the animal is, as is well known, a rare animal, and is not found in many countries.
In fact, in the whole of Europe it is only found in the strip between the rivers Achelous and Nessus.
The cubs of the lioness when newly born are exceedingly small, and can scarcely walk when two months old.
The Syrian lion bears cubs five times: five cubs at the first litter, then four, then three, then two, and lastly one; after this the lioness ceases to bear for the rest of her days.
The lioness has no mane, but this appendage is peculiar to the lion.
The lion sheds only the four so-called canines, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower; and it sheds them when it is six months old.
