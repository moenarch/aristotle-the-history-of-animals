## Part 28

The wild sow submits to the boar at the beginning of winter, and in the spring-time retreats for parturition to a lair in some district inaccessible to intrusion, hemmed in with sheer cliffs and chasms and overshadowed by trees.
The boar usually remains by the sow for thirty days.
The number of the litter and the period gestation is the same as in the case of the domesticated congener.
The sound of the grunt also is similar; only that the sow grunts continually, and the boar but seldom.
Of the wild boars such as are castrated grow to the largest size and become fiercest: to which circumstance Homer alludes when he says:-

'He reared against him a wild castrated boar: it was not like a food-devouring brute, but like a forest-clad promontory.'

Wild boars become castrated owing to an itch befalling them in early life in the region of the testicles, and the castration is superinduced by their rubbing themselves against the trunks of trees.
