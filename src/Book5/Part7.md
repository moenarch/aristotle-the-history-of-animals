## Part 7

Crustaceans copulate, as the crawfish, the lobster, the carid and the like, just like the opisthuretic quadrupeds, when the one animal turns up its tail and the other puts his tail on the other's tail.
Copulation takes place in the early spring, near to the shore; and, in fact, the process has often been observed in the case of all these animals.
Sometimes it takes place about the time when the figs begin to ripen.
Lobsters and carids copulate in like manner.

Crabs copulate at the front parts of one another, belly to belly, throwing their overlapping opercula to meet one another: first the smaller crab mounts the larger at the rear; after he has mounted, the larger one turns on one side.
Now, the female differs in no respect from the male except in the circumstance that its operculum is larger, more elevated, and more hairy, and into this operculum it spawns its eggs and in the same neighbourhood is the outlet of the residuum.
In the copulative process of these animals there is no protrusion of a member from one animal into the other.
