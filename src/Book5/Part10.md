## Part 10

Of cartilaginous fishes, the rhina or angelfish is the only one that breeds twice; for it breeds at the beginning of autumn, and at the setting of the Pleiads: and, of the two seasons, it is in better condition in the autumn.
It engenders at a birth seven or eight young.
Certain of the dog-fishes, for example the spotted dog, seem to breed twice a month, and this results from the circumstance that the eggs do not all reach maturity at the same time.

Some fishes breed at all seasons, as the muraena.
This animal lays a great number of eggs at a time; and the young when hatched are very small but grow with great rapidity, like the young of the hippurus, for these fishes from being diminutive at the outset grow with exceptional rapidity to an exceptional size.
(Be it observed that the muraena breeds at all seasons, but the hippurus only in the spring.
The smyrus differs from the smyraena; for the muraena is mottled and weakly, whereas the smyrus is strong and of one uniform colour, and the colour resembles that of the pine-tree, and the animal has teeth inside and out.
They say that in this case, as in other similar ones, the one is the male, and the other the female, of a single species.
They come out on to the land, and are frequently caught.)
Fishes, then, as a general rule, attain their full growth with great rapidity, but this is especially the case, among small fishes, with the coracine or crow-fish: it spawns, by the way, near the shore, in weedy and tangled spots.
The orphus also, or sea-perch, is small at first, and rapidly attains a great size.
The pelamys and the tunny breed in the Euxine, and nowhere else.
The cestreus or mullet, the chrysophrys or gilt-head, and the labrax or basse, breed best where rivers run into the sea.
The orcys or large-sized tunny, the scorpis, and many other species spawn in the open sea.
