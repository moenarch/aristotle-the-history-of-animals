## Part 23

Anthrenae and wasps construct combs for their young.
When they have no king, but are wandering about in search of one, the anthrene constructs its comb on some high place, and the wasp inside a hole.
When the anthrene and the wasp have a king, they construct their combs underground.
Their combs are in all cases hexagonal like the comb of the bee.
They are composed, however, not of wax, but of a bark-like filamented fibre, and the comb of the anthrene is much neater than the comb of the wasp.
Like the bee, they put their young just like a drop of liquid on to the side of the cell, and the egg clings to the wall of the cell.
But the eggs are not deposited in the cells simultaneously; on the contrary, in some cells are creatures big enough to fly, in others are nymphae, and in others are mere grubs.
As in the case of bees, excrement is observed only in the cells where the grubs are found.
As long as the creatures are in the nymph condition they are motionless, and the cell is cemented over.
In the comb of the anthrene there is found in the cell of the young a drop of honey in front of it.
The larvae of the anthrene and the wasp make their appearance not in the spring but in the autumn; and their growth is especially discernible in times of full moon.
And, by the way, the eggs and the grubs never rest at the bottom of the cells, but always cling on to the side wall.
