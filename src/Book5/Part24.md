## Part 24

There is a kind of humble-bee that builds a cone-shaped nest of clay against a stone or in some similar situation, besmearing the clay with something like spittle.
And this nest or hive is exceedingly thick and hard; in point of fact, one can hardly break it open with a spike.
Here the insects lay their eggs, and white grubs are produced wrapped in a black membrane.
Apart from the membrane there is found some wax in the honeycomb; and this a wax is much sallower in hue than the wax in the honeycomb of the bee.
