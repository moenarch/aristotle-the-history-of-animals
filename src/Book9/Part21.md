## Part 21

There is a bird that lives on rocks, called the blue-bird from its colour.
It is comparatively common in Nisyros, and is somewhat less than the owsel and a little bigger than the chaffinch.
It has large claws, and climbs on the face of the rocks.
It is steel-blue all over; its beak is long and slender; its legs are short, like those of the woodpecker.
