## Part 15

The hoopoe usually constructs its nest out of human excrement.
It changes its appearance in summer and in winter, as in fact do the great majority of wild birds.
(The titmouse is said to lay a very large quantity of eggs: next to the ostrich the blackheaded tit is said by some to lay the largest number of eggs; seventeen eggs have been seen; it lays, however, more than twenty; it is said always to lay an odd number.
Like others we have mentioned, it builds in trees; it feeds on caterpillars.)
A peculiarity of this bird and of the nightingale is that the outer extremity of the tongue is not sharp-pointed.

The aegithus finds its food with ease, has many young, and walks with a limp.
The golden oriole is apt at learning, is clever at making a living, but is awkward in flight and has an ugly plumage.
