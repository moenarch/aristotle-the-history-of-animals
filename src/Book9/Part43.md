## Part 43

Humble-bees produce their young under a stone, right on the ground, in a couple of cells or little more; in these cells is found an attempt at honey, of a poor description.
The tenthredon is like the anthrena, but speckled, and about as broad as a bee.
Being epicures as to their food, they fly, one at a time, into kitchens and on to slices of fish and the like dainties.
The tenthredon brings forth, like the wasp, underground, and is very prolific; its nest is much bigger and longer than that of the wasp.
So much for the methods of working and the habits of life of the bee, the wasp, and all the other similar insects.
