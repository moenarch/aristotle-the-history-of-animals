## Part 23

There is also the pardalus.
As a rule, it is seen in flocks and not singly; it is ashen-coloured all over, and about the size of the birds last described; it is fleet of foot and strong of wing, and its pipe is loud and high-pitched.
The collyrion (or fieldfare) feeds on the same food as the owsel; is of the same size as the above mentioned birds; and is trapped usually in the winter.
All these birds are found at all times.
Further, there are the birds that live as a rule in towns, the raven and the crow.
These also are visible at all seasons, never shift their place of abode, and never go into winter quarters.
