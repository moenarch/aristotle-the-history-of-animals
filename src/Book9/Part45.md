## Part 45

The bison is found in Paeonia on Mount Messapium, which separates Paeonia from Maedica; and the Paeonians call it the monapos.
It is the size of a bull, but stouter in build, and not long in the body; its skin, stretched tight on a frame, would give sitting room for seven people.
In general it resembles the ox in appearance, except that it has a mane that reaches down to the point of the shoulder, as that of the horse reaches down to its withers; but the hair in its mane is softer than the hair in the horse's mane, and clings more closely.
The colour of the hair is brown-yellow; the mane reaches down to the eyes, and is deep and thick.
The colour of the body is half red, half ashen-grey, like that of the so-called chestnut horse, but rougher.
It has an undercoat of woolly hair.
The animal is not found either very black or very red.
It has the bellow of a bull.
Its horns are crooked, turned inwards towards each other and useless for purposes of self-defence; they are a span broad, or a little more, and in volume each horn would hold about three pints of liquid; the black colour of the horn is beautiful and bright.
The tuft of hair on the forehead reaches down to the eyes, so that the animal sees objects on either flank better than objects right in front.
It has no upper teeth, as is the case also with kine and all other horned animals.
Its legs are hairy; it is cloven-footed, and the tail, which resembles that of the ox, seems not big enough for the size of its body.
It tosses up dust and scoops out the ground with its hooves, like the bull.
Its skin is impervious to blows.
Owing to the savour of its flesh it is sought for in the chase.
When it is wounded it runs away, and stops only when thoroughly exhausted.
It defends itself against an assailant by kicking and projecting its excrement to a distance of eight yards; this device it can easily adopt over and over again, and the excrement is so pungent that the hair of hunting-dogs is burnt off by it.
It is only when the animal is disturbed or alarmed that the dung has this property; when the animal is undisturbed it has no blistering effect.
So much for the shape and habits of the animal.
When the season comes for parturition the mothers give birth to their young in troops upon the mountains.
Before dropping their young they scatter their dung in all directions, making a kind of circular rampart around them; for the animal has the faculty of ejecting excrement in most extraordinary quantities.
