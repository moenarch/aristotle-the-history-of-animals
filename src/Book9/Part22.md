## Part 22

The oriole is yellow all over; it is not visible during winter, but puts in an appearance about the time of the summer solstice, and departs again at the rising of Arcturus; it is the size of the turtle-dove.
The so-called soft-head (or shrike) always settles on one and the same branch, where it falls a prey to the birdcatcher.
Its head is big, and composed of gristle; it is a little smaller than the thrush; its beak is strong, small, and round; it is ashen-coloured all over; is fleet of foot, but slow of wing.
The bird-catcher usually catches it by help of the owl.
