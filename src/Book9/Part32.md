## Part 32

Of eagles there are several species.
One of them, called 'the white-tailed eagle', is found on low lands, in groves, and in the neighbourhood of cities; some call it the 'heron-killer'.
It is bold enough to fly to mountains and the interior of forests.
The other eagles seldom visit groves or low-lying land.
There is another species called the 'plangus'; it ranks second in point of size and strength; it lives in mountain combes and glens, and by marshy lakes, and goes by the name of 'duck-killer' and 'swart-eagle.'
It is mentioned by Homer in his account of the visit made by Priam to the tent of Achilles.
There is another species with black Plumage, the smallest but boldest of all the kinds.
It dwells on mountains or in forests, and is called 'the black-eagle' or 'the hare-killer'; it is the only eagle that rears its young and thoroughly takes them out with it.
It is swift of flight, is neat and tidy in its habits, too proud for jealousy, fearless, quarrelsome; it is also silent, for it neither whimpers nor screams.
There is another species, the percnopterus, very large, with white head, very short wings, long tail-feathers, in appearance like a vulture.
It goes by the name of 'mountain-stork' or 'half-eagle'.
It lives in groves; has all the bad qualities of the other species, and none of the good ones; for it lets itself be chased and caught by the raven and the other birds.
It is clumsy in its movements, has difficulty in procuring its food, preys on dead animals, is always hungry, and at all times whining and screaming.
There is another species, called the 'sea-eagle' or 'osprey'.
This bird has a large thick neck, curved wings, and broad tailfeathers; it lives near the sea, grasps its prey with its talons, and often, from inability to carry it, tumbles down into the water.
There is another species called the 'true-bred'; people say that these are the only true-bred birds to be found, that all other birds-eagles, hawks, and the smallest birds-are all spoilt by the interbreeding of different species.
The true-bred eagle is the largest of all eagles; it is larger than the phene; is half as large again as the ordinary eagle, and has yellow plumage; it is seldom seen, as is the case with the so-called cymindis.
The time for an eagle to be on the wing in search of prey is from midday to evening; in the morning until the market-hour it remains on the nest.
In old age the upper beak of the eagle grows gradually longer and more crooked, and the bird dies eventually of starvation; there is a folklore story that the eagle is thus punished because it once was a man and refused entertainment to a stranger.
The eagle puts aside its superfluous food for its young; for owing to the difficulty in procuring food day by day, it at times may come back to the nest with nothing.
If it catch a man prowling about in the neighbourhood of its nest, it will strike him with its wings and scratch him with its talons.
The nest is built not on low ground but on an elevated spot, generally on an inaccessible ledge of a cliff; it does, however, build upon a tree.
The young are fed until they can fly; hereupon the parent-birds topple them out of the nest, and chase them completely out of the locality.
The fact is that a pair of eagles demands an extensive space for its maintenance, and consequently cannot allow other birds to quarter themselves in close neighbourhood.
They do not hunt in the vicinity of their nest, but go to a great distance to find their prey.
When the eagle has captured a beast, it puts it down without attempting to carry it off at once; if on trial it finds the burden too heavy, it will leave it.
When it has spied a hare, it does not swoop on it at once, but lets it go on into the open ground; neither does it descend to the ground at one swoop, but goes gradually down from higher flights to lower and lower: these devices it adopts by way of security against the stratagem of the hunter.
It alights on high places by reason of the difficulty it experiences in soaring up from the level ground; it flies high in the air to have the more extensive view; from its high flight it is said to be the only bird that resembles the gods.
Birds of prey, as a rule, seldom alight upon rock, as the crookedness of their talons prevents a stable footing on hard stone.
The eagle hunts hares, fawns, foxes, and in general all such animals as he can master with ease.
It is a long-lived bird, and this fact might be inferred from the length of time during which the same nest is maintained in its place.
