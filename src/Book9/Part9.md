## Part 9

The woodpecker does not squat on the ground, but pecks at the bark of trees to drive out from under it maggots and gnats; when they emerge, it licks them up with its tongue, which is large and flat.
It can run up and down a tree in any way, even with the head downwards, like the gecko-lizard.
For secure hold upon a tree, its claws are better adapted than those of the daw; it makes its way by sticking these claws into the bark.
One species of woodpecker is smaller than a blackbird, and has small reddish speckles; a second species is larger than the blackbird, and a third is not much smaller than a barn-door hen.
It builds a nest on trees, as has been said, on olive trees amongst others.
It feeds on the maggots and ants that are under the bark: it is so eager in the search for maggots that it is said sometimes to hollow a tree out to its downfall.
A woodpecker once, in course of domestication, was seen to insert an almond into a hole in a piece of timber, so that it might remain steady under its pecking; at the third peck it split the shell of the fruit, and then ate the kernel.
