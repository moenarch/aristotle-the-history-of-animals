## Part 20

Of thrushes there are three species.
One is the misselthrush; it feeds only on mistletoe and resin; it is about the size of the jay.
A second is the song-thrush; it has a sharp pipe, and is about the size of the owsel.
There is another species called the Illas; it is the smallest species of the three, and is less variegated in plumage than the others.
