## Part 10

Of the eye the white is pretty much the same in all creatures; but what is called the black differs in various animals.
Some have the rim black, some distinctly blue, some greyish-blue, some greenish; and this last colour is the sign of an excellent disposition, and is particularly well adapted for sharpness of vision.
Man is the only, or nearly the only, creature, that has eyes of diverse colours.
Animals, as a rule, have eyes of one colour only.
Some horses have blue eyes.

Of eyes, some are large, some small, some medium-sized; of these, the medium-sized are the best.
Moreover, eyes sometimes protrude, sometimes recede, sometimes are neither protruding nor receding.
Of these, the receding eye is in all animals the most acute; but the last kind are the sign of the best disposition.
Again, eyes are sometimes inclined to wink under observation, sometimes to remain open and staring, and sometimes are disposed neither to wink nor stare.
The last kind are the sign of the best nature, and of the others, the latter kind indicates impudence, and the former indecision.
