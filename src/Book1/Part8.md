## Part 8

The part that lies under the skull is called the 'face': but in the case of man only, for the term is not applied to a fish or to an ox.
In the face the part below the sinciput and between the eyes is termed the forehead.
When men have large foreheads, they are slow to move; when they have small ones, they are fickle; when they have broad ones, they are apt to be distraught; when they have foreheads rounded or bulging out, they are quick-tempered.
